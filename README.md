# A brief description of our visualization: 
We aim to explore the gender pay gap in the United States. To support this analysis, we identified several datasets that offer valuable insights into wage disparities. These datasets highlight differences in earnings between men and women across various occupations, educational levels, and racial groups. They also reveal how the gender wage gap has evolved over time, emphasizing its persistent and widespread nature.
